  Students will read about, understand, and discuss the impact of climate change
  on human rights in the context of ecosystems and natural resources; human
  settlements; and livelihoods, health, and security. They will also learn about
  specific governmental obligations to protect human rights of different groups
  of people in the context of the environment and climate change. Further,
  students will read about mechanisms to evaluate the measures that address human
  rights considerations, and will learn about recommendations to better integrate
  human rights into climate-specific actions at the national and international level.
