title: Reconstruction of Paleoclimate
url: http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/climate/labs/vostok/

description: A classroom/laboratory activity to learn about the isotopes of
  hydrogen and oxygen, analyze the isotopic composition of ice, and understand
  how isotopic compositions can be used to recreate past temperatures and climate.

learningOutcomes: |
  Students will plot graphs to analyze data from the Vostok ice core in
  Antarctica, learn about the ice age and the gas age, calculate past
  temperatures using hydrogen isotope data, and discuss the possible impacts of
  changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations on climate.

  Use this tool to help your students find answers to:
  1. How can you use hydrogen isotope data in an ice core to determine temperature?
  2. How can the isotopic composition of air bubbles in ice cores be used to recreate past climate?
