integer:
  title: Integer
  text: "The __integers__ are the positive and negative whole numbers including
    zero: …, –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …"

term:
  title: Term (Algebra)
  text: A __term__ in an algebraic expression or equation is a single number or
    variable, or the product of several numbers and variables separated from
    another term by a + or – sign.

variable:
  title: Variable
  text: A __variable__ is an unknown quantity in an algebraic expression, which
    is usually represented by a letter like _x_.

coefficient:
  title: Coefficient
  text: __Coefficients__ are the numbers in front of the variables in a
    mathematical expression or equation. For example, in the expression
    `4x + 5y^2 + 3z`, the coefficients of `x`, `y^2` and `z` are 4, 5 and 3.

polynomial:
  title: Polynomial
  text: A __polynomial__ is an algebraic expression that consists of constants
    and multiples of variables and their powers. An example would be
    `5x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 4`.

polynomial-degree:
  title: Degree
  text: The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of any variables in it.
    For example, the degree of `5x^3 + 2x - 4` is 3.

quadratic:
  title: Quadratic
  text: A __quadratic__ is a polynomial of degree 2. For example, `x^2 - 2x + 3`
    is a quadratic.

function:
  title: Function
  text: A __function__ is a mathematical relation that converts inputs (_x_)
    into outputs (_y_). They are often expressed as mathematical equations of
    the form `f(x)`.

function-graph:
  title: Graphs of Functions
  text: We can plot mathematical functions of the form `f(x)` in a coordinate
    system. The result is called the __graph__ of the function.

derivative:
  title: Derivative of a function
  text: The __derivative__ of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point.

sequence:
  title: Sequence
  text: A __sequence__ is an ordered list of numbers of elements that are
    usually detemined using some function or patterns. Sequences can be both
    finite and infinite.

parallel:
  title: Parallel lines
  text: Two or more lines are __parallel__ if they never intersect. They have
    the same slope and the distance between them is always constant.

perpendicular:
  title: Perpendicular lines
  text: Two lines are __perpendicular__ if they intersect at a right angle.

equilateral-triangle:
  title: Equilateral triangle
  text: An __equilateral triangle__ is a triangle in which all three sides have
    the same length.

right-triangle:
  title: Right-angled triangle
  text: In a __right-angled triangle__, one angle is exactly 90°.

hypotenuse:
  title: Hypotenuse
  text: The __hypotenuse__ of a right-angled triangle is its longest side, which
    lies oppsite the right angle.

polygon:
  title: Polygon
  text: A __polygon__ is geometric shape that is made up of straight line
    segments. Polygons cannot contain any curved sides, or holes. For example, a
    square is a polygon but a circle is not.

regular-polygon:
  title: Regular polygon
  text: A __regular polygon__ is a polygon in which all sides have the same
    length and all angles have the same size.

quadrilateral:
  title: Quadrilateral
  text: A __quadrilateral__ is a polygon with four sides.

square:
  title: Square
  text: A __square__ is a regular quadrilateral: all sides have the same length,
    and all angles have the same size.

rectangle:
  title: Rectangle
  text: A __rectangle__ is a quadrilateral in which all angles are 90°.

parallelogram:
  title: Parallelogram
  text: A __parallelogram__ is a quadrilateral in which both pairs of
    opposite sides are parallel.

trapezium:
  title: Trapezium
  text: A __trapezium__ (or __trapezoid__) is a quadrilateral in which one pair
    of opposite sides are parallel.

polyhedron:
  title: Polyhedron
  text: A __polyhedron__ (the plural is _polyhedra_) is a 3-dimensional solid
    with no curves surfaces or edges. All faces of a polyhedron are polygons.
    For example, a cube and a pyramid are polyhedra, but a sphere is not.

pi:
  title: Pi
  text: __Pi__, often written as the Greek letter `π`, is the ratio of the
    circumference and te diameter of a circle. Its value is approximately
    3.14159265...

circle:
  title: Circle
  text: A __circle__ is the set of all points at a specific distance from a
    given point in two dimensions.

circle-diameter:
  title: Diameter (circle)
  text: The __diameter__ of a circle is the distance across the center of a
    circle. It is equal to twice the radius of the circle.

circle-radius:
  title: Radius
  text: The __radius__ of a circle is the distance from its center to its edge.

circle-circumference:
  title: Circumference (circle)
  text: The __circumference__ of a circle is the length around its outside edge.

factor:
  title: Factor
  text: A number _a_ is a __factor__ (or divisor) of a number _b_, if you can
    divide _b_ by _a_ without remainder.

divisor:
  title: Divisor
  text: __Divisor__ is just another name for _factor_.

multiple:
  title: Multiple
  text: A number _a_ is a __multiple__ of a number _b_, if _b_ is a factor of _a_.

prime:
  title: Prime Number
  text: A __prime number__ is an integer that has no divisors other than 1 and
    itself.

prime-factor:
  title: Prime Factor
  text: A __prime factor__ of a number is simply a factor which is prime.

factorisation:
  title: Prime Factorisation
  text: The __prime factorisation__ of a number is a way to write it as a
    product of prime numbers.
