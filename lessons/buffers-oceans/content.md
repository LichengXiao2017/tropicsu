# Buffers, Buffer Action and Ocean Acidification

## Overview
> section: overview

This lesson plan introduces the topic of buffers and describes carbonate buffering in the ocean when atmospheric `CO_2` dissolves in seawater. The buffering capacity of the ocean is, however, limited, and therefore, higher concentrations of dissolved `CO_2` can lead to ocean acidification. Students will use a computer-based activity/model to explore how higher atmospheric `CO_2` levels (resulting in an increase in dissolved CO2) can lead to ocean acidification. Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, or Earth Sciences.

## Buffer solutions
> section: intro
> format: Reading
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
Introduce the topic of buffers. Use the reading “Introduction to Buffers” to explain buffer action and the maintenance of pH in a buffer solution.

Explain the term buffer capacity, buffer range, and the pH equation of a given buffer. Use examples in the text “How Does A Buffer Maintain pH?” to calculate changes in the pH values when a weak acid or base is added to a buffer solution.

Discuss other examples of buffers in daily life, e.g., the buffering action of blood.
:::


In chemistry, a buffer solution is a solution that resists the changes of its pH when an acid or base is added. 

On this lesson we introduce the topic of buffers and describe carbonate buffering in the ocean when atmospheric `CO_2` dissolves in seawater. The buffering capacity of the ocean is, however, limited, and therefore, higher concentrations of dissolved `CO_2` can lead to ocean acidification. We will use a computer-based activity/model to explore how higher atmospheric `CO_2` levels (resulting in an increase in dissolved `CO_2`) can lead to ocean acidification.

## Ocean buffer chemistry
> section: video
> format: Video
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use the video micro-lecture “Ocean Buffer Chemistry” to describe carbonate buffering in the ocean.

Discuss how oceans behave as carbon sinks by absorbing atmospheric `CO_2`, and the maintenance of ocean pH levels owing to the buffering capacity of sea water. Further, use the video to explain the buffering range of oceans and the chemical implications of a higher concentration of dissolved `CO_2` (due to increased levels of atmospheric `CO_2`).

Explain how high levels of atmospheric `CO_2` could result in an excess of free hydrogen (H+) ions, thus potentially changing the pH values of seawater (acidification).

Further, use the video micro-lecture to illustrate Le Chatelier’s Principle—explain how increased `CO_2` concentration in seawater sequesters more carbonate (`CO_3^{2-}`) ions to keep the system in equilibrium. In conclusion, explain how ocean biota may be affected in the absence of freely available carbonate (`CO_3^{2-}`) ions.

## Mauna Loa Observatory
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> duration: 60 min

::: .teaching-notes
Help your students apply the learned concepts through a classroom activity. This
activity uses atmospheric `CO_2` data from the Mauna Loa Observatory for the period 1950 to 2017.

This activity will help students to
* observe the trend in increasing atmospheric `CO_2` levels.
* infer the approximate year when atmospheric `CO_2` levels could cause global
  temperatures to increase by 2°C (leading to serious climate change-related
  problems).
* determine the desired trends in atmospheric `CO_2` levels that could help in
  avoiding or mitigating such climate change-related consequences.

On the worksheet, do exercises 1-6 to predict atmospheric `CO_2` levels in the
future. Discuss the possible impact of these trends on global temperature and
climate. You can expand this activity to introduce the concept of curve fitting.

::: column.grow
The [Mauna Loa Observatory](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/), in the
Pacific islands of Hawaii (USA), is a research facility that monitors and
collects data on the atmosphere since the 1950s.

Here we will use some data on the concentration of carbon dioxide (`CO_2`) on
the atmosphere. The observatory records values of the concentration regularly
for long periods of time (years), so we end up with a collection of points
(time, concentration).

Using a technique called _curve fitting_, we can find the polynomial function
that best describes the relation between the two variables, by passing the
closest possible to all the points. 

Once we have a mathematical description of the physical measures, we can use
mathematical tools (such as the derivatives) to analyze and extract information
from the data.
