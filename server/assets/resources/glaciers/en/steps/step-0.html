<x-step id="step-0"><p>As a high school or undergraduate Geography or Earth Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching about glaciers, the cryosphere, and related topics such as the impact of temperature and precipitation on glacial mass, glacial budgets, and glacial advance and retreat. This lesson plan helps students learn about glaciers, and the factors that affect the movement and size of glaciers. The activity will also enable students to understand the possible impacts of climate change on glaciers and the climate-cryosphere link. Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Earth Science or Geography.</p><div class="teaching-notes"> <table> <tbody><tr> <td align="left"><strong>Grade Level</strong></td><td align="left">High school, Undergraduate</td></tr> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>Discipline</strong></td><td align="left">Geography, Earth Sciences</td></tr> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>Topic(s) in Discipline</strong></td><td align="left">Glaciers, Cryosphere</td></tr> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>Climate Topic</strong></td><td align="left">Climate and Cryosphere</td></tr> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>Location</strong></td><td align="left">Global</td></tr> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>Languages</strong></td><td align="left">English</td></tr> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>Access</strong></td><td align="left">Online</td></tr> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>Approximate Time Required</strong></td><td align="left">120 min</td></tr> </tbody></table> </div> <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2><p>The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to :</p><ul> <li>describe glaciers and their formation</li><li>discuss the factors affecting the shrinking and growing of a glacier</li><li>determine how climate change-related temperature variations may impact glaciers</li></ul> </x-step>
