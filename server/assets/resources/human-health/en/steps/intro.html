This illness affects the human liver and blood and kills one-to-two million people every year.</p><p>Many factors limit the spread of the disease, foremost of which may be the temperature. Malaria generally spreads into regions where minimum temperatures fall no lower than 16° C (61° F).</p><p>Global changes in the climate and temperature affect the risks of spreading Malaria in different regions.</p></x-step>
