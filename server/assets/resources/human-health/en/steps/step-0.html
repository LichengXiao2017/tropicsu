<x-step id="step-0"><p>This lesson plan allows students to study the geographical distribution and spread of diseases. Further, students can explore how climate change could impact the spread of vector-borne diseases (specifically, malaria) and could consequently affect human health outcomes. The activity will also help students to identify policies for adapting to and mitigating the spread of diseases.</p><p>Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in the Biological Sciences.</p><p><strong>Grade Level</strong>: High School<br><strong>Discipline</strong>: Biological Sciences, Environmental Sciences<br><strong>Topic(s) in Discipline</strong>: Protozoa, Vectors, Vector-borne Diseases, Malaria, Climate Change and the Spread of Malaria, Climate Change and Human Health<br><strong>Climate Topic</strong> : Climate and Health<br><strong>Location</strong>: Global, USA<br><strong>Languages</strong>: English<br><strong>Access</strong>: Online (some material can be downloaded for offline use)<br><strong>Approximate Time Required</strong>: 150-190 min </p><h2>Learning outcomes</h2><p>The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:</p><ul> <li>enumerate some vectors and the diseases that they cause</li><li>discuss the causes for the spread of vector-borne diseases</li><li>explain the possible link between climate change and the distribution/spread of infectious vector-borne diseases</li><li>discuss climate change-related actions and policies that will help in adapting to and mitigating the spread of vector-borne diseases</li></ul> </x-step>
