# Glaciers, Glacial Retreat, Cryosphere

## Lesson Plan
> section: overview

As a high school or undergraduate Geography or Earth Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching about glaciers, the cryosphere, and related topics such as the impact of temperature and precipitation on glacial mass, glacial budgets, and glacial advance and retreat.
This lesson plan helps students learn about glaciers, and the factors that affect the movement and size of glaciers. The activity will also enable students to understand the possible impacts of climate change on glaciers and the climate-cryosphere link.
Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Earth Science or Geography.

::: .teaching-notes
__Reading (20-30 min)__

Introduce the topic through an online reading

* Introduce the topic of glaciers and their formation.
* Use the following resources as the primary or supplementary reading material to teach your students about glaciers, their formation, and the components of a glacier, by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC):
* [What is a glacier](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/questions/what.html)
* [How are glaciers formed]( https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/questions/formed.html)
* [What are the components of a glacier?](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/questions/components.html)

::: .teaching-notes
__Classroom/Laboratory Activitiy (15 min)__


* Explore the topic in further detail through a classroom/laboratory activity [The Future of Glaciers](https://imaginary.org/program/future-of-glaciers-the-module), by IMAGINARY.
* Conduct the activity and discuss how glaciers are affected by changes in temperature and snowfall.
* Discuss how temperature changes caused by climate change may impact glaciers globally.
* Discuss how the study of glaciers can help in drawing inferences about the Earth’s changing climate.

:::

This is an interactive visualization and associated activity to visualize the shrinking and growing of a Alpine Glaciers as a result of changes in snowfall and temperature.

## Classroom Activity

> duration: 60 min

::: .teaching-notes

__Classroom/Laboratory Activity (60 min)__


* Help your students investigate the melting of glaciers through a classroom/laboratory activity, “When will there no longer be glaciers in Glacier National Park” from SERC Carleton, developed by Carol Ormand, Wittenberg University. In this activity, students will analyze and interpret historical data for the Grinnell Glacier to predict when the glacier might completely melt. 
* Download the activity handout and share it with the students. 
* This activity needs some images of the Grinnell Glacier provided by USGS, which are available here. Download them and print them for the students.

## Questions and Assignments
> section: exercises
> id: exercises

::: .teaching-notes
Propose the following questions to your students and help them to find some answers.
:::

Use the tools and the concepts learned so far to discuss and determine answers to the following questions:

1. What climatic and environmental factors affect the size and motion of glaciers?
2. How has an increase in global temperatures led to the shrinking of some glaciers?
3. What is the relationship between climate and the cryosphere?
4. How do glaciers provide evidence of climate change?
