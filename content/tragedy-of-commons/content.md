# Tragedy of the Commons

## Lesson Plan
> section: overview

As an undergraduate Economics teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching the concept of the tragedy of the commons.
This lesson plan will help students to understand the concept of tragedy of the commons, and to identify the “commons” and the “tragedy” in some example problems. In the activity, students will examine climate change as a tragedy of the commons and will discuss possible economic solutions (policy, development) for the problem.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a topic in Economics.

### Learning Outcomes
The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to :

* describe tragedy of the commons
* provide examples of tragedy-of-the-commons problems
* identify the commons and the tragedy in a given tragedy-of-the-commons problem
* examine climate change as a tragedy-of-the-commons problem
* propose economic solutions (policy, development) for the climate change tragedy-of-the-commons

> duration: 11 min

::: .teaching-notes
__Video (11 min)__

Play the video "The tragedy of the commons", which can be used as a  micro-lecture.

* Play the micro-lecture [“Tragedy of the Commons”](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/sustainability/tragedy-of-the-commons-MtxUU), delivered by Dr. Jonathan Tomkin, to introduce the concept of tragedy of the commons.
* Guide a brief discussionamong students to cite other examples of the tragedy of the commons problem,andto identify the “commons” and the “tragedy” in each example.

:::

What does it mean for you the expression "the tragedy of the commons"? Watch the following video and give examples to explain the terms “tragedy” and “commons”.

::: .teaching-notes
__Classroom/Laboratory activities (50 min)__


* Explore the topic in further detail through a classroom/laboratory activity [“Introducing the economic concept of ‘tragedy of the commons’ using global warming”](https://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/programs/implementation/program2/activities/135953.html), by Laura Triplett, from Gustavus Adolphus College.
* In this activity, students will discuss case studies for different tragedy-of-the-commons problems. Then, they will examine Earth’s atmosphere as a commons and global warming as a tragedy, and will propose economic solutions to solve this tragedy.
* Download the Teaching Materials and conduct the activity described on the page.

__Reading (60 min)__


* Discuss the solutions though reading [“Climate Change: The Ultimate Tragedy of the Commons”](https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/pubfiles/climate-change_0.pdf) by Jouni Paavola in “Property in Land and Other Resources”.

* This reading describes climate change as a tragedy of the commons problem (atmospheric sinks for greenhouse gases are the commons) and analyzes the current state of climate change governance. It also discusses polycentricity as a governance approach to address global climate change at various levels and scales, providing specific examples ofthe Cities for Climate Change program and the Cement Sustainability Initiative.

> id: exercises

::: .teaching-notes
Propose the following questions to your students and help them to find some answers.
:::

Use the tools and the concepts learned so far to discuss and determine answers to the following questions:

1. Describe the concept of tragedy of the commons.
2. Discuss climate change as a tragedy-of-the-commons problem. Identify the “commons” and the “tragedy”.
3. Explain why “atmospheric sinks for greenhouse gases” can be considered as a “commons”.
4. Discuss different types of governance solutions for climate change as a tragedy of the commons. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each type of solution.
